# The Organization:

Voices of Consent is a nonprofit organization whose goal is to support survivors after a traumatic experience. Locally based, this nonprofit operates in 42 states to help survivors. In the aftermath of a traumatic event, Voices of Consent sends a box to a survivor who requests one.

Survivor Boxes are personalized packages put together to let survivors know they are not alone after an event, that include resources to use as survivors begin the recovery process (including information about laws in their state, free health and counseling services in their area).

Voices of Consent gets the word out to survivors by talking at schools and churches. The boxes are sent to survivors who request them directly, or can be picked up at hospitals or police stations.

# Background
We've started a few reference documents based on questions we've been asked. Make sure you also read our [background.md](notes/background.md), and check out the [database-diagram.png](notes/database-diagram.png) all of which is located in the [/notes](notes) folder in the repo.

Also located in the [/notes](notes) folder is [database-diagram.dot](notes/database-diagram.dot) which is used to create the [database diagram.png](notes/database-diagram.png). If you want to edit this file and generate new versions of the [database-diagram.png](notes/database-diagram.png), visit http://graphviz.it/ and paste the code from your [database-diagram.dot](notes/database-diagram.dot). Make sure you erase all the code on this website and replace it with the entire contents of your .dot file to see your diagram properly.

If you want to know more about how to update the [database-diagram.png](notes/database-diagram.png), please checkout Casey Watts' instructional post on graphviz at https://gist.github.com/caseywatts/be69bf941fa1f8e264bd07de698366a0.

# Setting Up Development

This is a Ruby on Rails 5.2 application with React + Webpack included.

To get started developing on your machine, you'll need the following tools installed:

* ruby 2.6
* node 10+
* yarn 1.16+
* bundler 2+

Some choices for how to run services in your development environment:
* [Heroku Command Line Interface](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/command-line)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to use the docker-compose steps or you will need to install these services individually on your development host:
    * Redis 4+
    * PostgreSQL 9.5+
    * Mailcatcher 0.7.1

## Running the App!

First, set up Local Services (Via Docker or individually installed services as described in the **Starting Local Services** section below.).

Then to run the app locally,

```
$ bundle install
$ yarn install
$ rake dev:setup
$ heroku local -f Procfile.dev
# if you chose the local route, then you are good to go on:
  http://localhost:5000
  $ rspec (to run the test suite) or bundle exec rspec (if the first does not work)
# If you chose the Docker route:
  $ docker-compose up -d -or- $ docker-compose up
  http://localhost:3000
$ rspec (to run the test suite)

$ View `seeds.rb` file for login email and password to use while working in development
```

## Starting Local Services

### ... with Docker!

If you opted to install Docker Desktop, `docker-compose up -d` will run dependency services like PostgreSQL (the database), Redis (the job queue), and Mailcatcher (a fake SMTP mail server for testing). Services will run in the background. NOTE: these services will attempt to use some commonly used ports (e.g. 5432 for PostgreSQL) on localhost, so if you see errors about conflicting ports, you may have the corresponding service already running elsewhere on your development host.

```
$ docker-compose up -d
Starting db          ... done
Starting cache       ... done
Starting mailcatcher ... done

$ docker-compose ps
             Name                            Command               State                                 Ports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
voices-of-consent_cache_1         docker-entrypoint.sh redis ...   Up      127.0.0.1:6379->6379/tcp
voices-of-consent_db_1            docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up      127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp
voices-of-consent_mailcatcher_1   mailcatcher --foreground - ...   Up      127.0.0.1:1025->1025/tcp, 127.0.0.1:1080->1080/tcp, 25/tcp, 80/tcp
```

Stop the services with `docker-compose stop`.

```
$ docker-compose stop
Stopping voices-of-consent_mailcatcher_1 ... done
Stopping voices-of-consent_db_1          ... done
Stopping voices-of-consent_cache_1       ... done
```

If you prefer to keep an eye on what these background services are doing (or whether they're up!), you can run `docker-compose up` instead of `start` to keep the processes in the foreground. You will need to dedicate a terminal window to this display and continue working on the project in a new terminal session. Stop the services with CTRL-C in the terminal they are running in.

```
$ docker-compose up
Starting voices-of-consent_db_1          ... done
Starting voices-of-consent_cache_1       ... done
Starting voices-of-consent_mailcatcher_1 ... done

```

### ... with individually installed services

Ensure Redis is running. `brew services start redis` on macOS or `redis-server` to run it as a one-off process.

Ensure Postgres is running. We recommend Postgres.app for macOS if you don't already have it installed.

Mailcatcher cannot be bundled, for that reason we must use:

```
$ gem install mailcatcher
```

To get the MailCatcher gem's mail server up run:

```
$ mailcatcher
Go to http://localhost:1080/
Send mail through smtp://localhost:1025
```

You only need this if you're interested in working on emails in the development environment.

### Re-seeding development database
To reset your development database with realistic data, run `rake dev:setup`. To add additional fake data during development after you have already run `rake dev:setup`, you can use `rake db:seed:dev`.


### Testing
When writing tests for rspec tests within the spec/request directory, you can use Warden::Test:Helpers
which give you access to the ```login_as(user, :scope => :user)``` method, as well as the ```logout``` method.
You use FactoryBot.create(:user) before the login_as method and pass it in as the required resource variable.
BE SURE to include the line ```after { Warden.test_reset! } ``` after the before do block with the login_as method
within it. This allows for any unexpected state data of the user from hanging around and causing errors.

Additional testing for front_end specs should make use of Capybara ```sign_in/sign_out``` Capybara methods.

### App Startup Troubleshooting
If you Recieve an error when trying to run

```
$ heroku local -f Procfile.dev
```

that looks like this ...

```

Run -
``` $ ps aux | grep node ```
and then use the following command on any PIDs that have voices of consent in the path, or mentions node/procfiles

```
kill -9 <PID #>
```
Then Re-run -

```
$ heroku local -f Procfile.dev
